NRK-OPPTAK / NRK-RECORDER

CHANGES

=============================================================================











-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-6-

Updated README and COMPAT.
Minor cosmetics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-5-

Now also working with radio.nrk.no, nrk.no/skole and www.nrk.no. NRK Radio is
just like NRK TV. NRK Skole and the NRK website in general get videos from
nrk.no/embed/.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-4-

Add 'omtale' to metadata.

Add start date and time to filename for live recording.

AdobeHDS will now use existing 'tmp' or 'temp' sub directories for
fragment files.

MP4Box is added for better support for subtitles in mp4 files.

Allow download of mp4 and mkv without subtitles.
Options: M and K

Chapters in mp4 files (MP4Box w/ttxt).

Option: x
Downloading all supporting files (in addition to video).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-2-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1-

Removed as many dependencies as possible.

Subtitles are now handled internally (which skips a few perl modules).
This will hopefully help installation on non-linux comps.

You will need PHP and AdobeHDS.php. This is still the most reliable 
solution to get the high quality streams. 

You can still piggyback nrk-subtitles if you want. But we have our own internal
subs converter.

I've added repackaging to mp4 and mkv with subtitles. The latter one also
incorporates chapters into the package.

Also added more screen scraping and metadata extraction from the html.
